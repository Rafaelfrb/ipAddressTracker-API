# ipAddressTracker-API

Using two API's to get the clients IP address and get their location, internet service provider, time zone... and the second API uses lat and long provided
by the first API to render the map in the page. 

In this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to consume the API's and render the page with the results.

When you first access the page your IP address will be inside the search field. You can erase your IP address and type another IP address if you want.

Click the black button and the API will search for your IP address information.
